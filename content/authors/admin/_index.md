It was after facing a continuous struggle to convince that I truly understood the power of storytelling. I first learned in the Supply Chain industry how important stories are to convey clear ideas and make impactful decisions. This is how I got introduced to Data Science and fell in love with it.  

Today, I use data on a daily basis to understand current practices, suggest improvements, and make predictions. I am familiar with Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau, among other tools. I see them as a means to an end, to solve a problem or present a vision.

I'm currently looking to contribute to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, highly-motivated Data Scientist, let's chat. You can reach me on email  <a href="mailto:bricechivu@gmail.com">  {{< icon name="envelope" pack="fas" >}}</a> or by DMing me on LinkedIn.
